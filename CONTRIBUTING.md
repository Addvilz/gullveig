# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute in any way you see fit - code contributions, bug fixes, documentation, issues are all welcome.

When submitting issues, please include as much information as possible - as a minimum, debug log output, details about your system, Gullveig and Python versions.

By submitting code to this project, you confirm that all the source contributions shall be licensed under Apache 2.0 license.

Please, open a ticket or comment on existing ticket before working on any code changes to avoid code conflicts and to confirm that your changes can be incorporated in the codebase before spending time implementing them.

## Filing issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Addvilz/gullveig/issues) are used for all the discussions about the codebase, 
including **bugs** and **features**.

### Reporting a Bug

Good bug reports can be very helpful. A bug is a demonstrable problem with the code.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Please use the [GitHub issue search](https://github.com/Addvilz/gullveig/issues) â€” check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has already been fixed in the latest releases.

A good bug report should be as detailed as possible, so that others won't have to follow up for the essential details.

### Requesting a Feature

1. [Search the issues](https://github.com/Addvilz/gullveig/issues) for any previous requests for the same feature, and give a thumbs up or +1 on existing requests.
1. If no previous requests exist, create a new issue. Please be as clear as possible about why the feature is needed and the intended use case.

## Contributing code

If you plan to propose code changes it is required you create an
issue [issue](https://github.com/Addvilz/gullveig/issues/new) with a brief proposal (as described in
Requesting a Feature) and discuss it with us first.

This is necessary to avoid more than one contributor working on the same feature/change and to avoid someone spending time on feature/change that would not be merged for some reason.

For smaller contributions just use this workflow:

* Create an issue describing the changes.
* Await confirmation from contributors.
* Fork the project.
* Create a branch for your feature or bug fix.
* Add code changes.
* Send a pull request.

After one of the contributors has checked and approved the changes, they will be merged into master branch and will be included in the next release.
