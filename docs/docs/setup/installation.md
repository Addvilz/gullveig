Gullveig is distributed using [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/gullveig/) as a mono-package - meaning, all the
components are distributed using single installable artefact. Once installed, commands for
starting the reporting server, agent and web user interface will be made available in your system. 

To install Gullveig, execute this command:

```bash
pip3 install gullveig
```
