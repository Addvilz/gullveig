## DEPRECATED as of 16.03.2021

This software is deprecated as of 16.03.2021 and will receive no further updates. If you are interested in
taking over the development of this project, submit a GitHub ticket.

### Why?

I initially created Gullveig as an all-in-one alternative to Nagios, Monit etc. However, after about a year
of private deployment I have concluded that while concept of Gullveig is still valid, it failed to
address the main point I initially set out to solve with it - ease of management and deployment, and
to provide ability to consistently and reliably monitor systems integrity.

Because there is no need for another Grafana and Nagios, I have decided to deprecate this project
and focus on something conceptually quite different.

that can be created using nearly any platform or programming language.
